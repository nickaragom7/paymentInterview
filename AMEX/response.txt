As well, I am really sorry for the disruption in your system and the 503 error you are presenting. This type of error is related to unavailable services from our end, the reason of this is that, as I explained we are always willing to provide the best service to our clients and our systems have been upgraded in the past 2 weeks and therefore for high volume transactions clients, as you, services might get disturbed. 

However, I can totally assure that Engineering Team and Technical Support level 3 have been notified on the current situation, and we together, as PayU Team, will be monitoring your merchants traffic and every of your transactions taking place with us.

As well, we already implemented a backup server in case the situation you experienced, takes place once again. As with this, PayU can assure that this will never take place again, instead of that, I just created a ticket to escalate to the teams I mentioned, and they will be working actively to prevent this situation for you, other merchants and individuals within our system.

Lastly, I will keep an eye on your company's status on our end to supervise how the issue develops during the next 72 hours, your case number for this will be 123498765.
